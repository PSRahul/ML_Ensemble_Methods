# ML_Ensemble_Methods

The projects contain an investigation on ensemble machine learning methods for the MNIST dataset.

An soft-voting classifier was trained based on Random Forests and Support Vector Machine for the MNIST dataset. The optimised model achieved an test accuracy of 97.42%

A stacking classifier was also trained based on Random forests, extremely randomized Forests and Support Vector Machine that classified a test accuracy of 97.08%

Models based on Scikit-Learn
