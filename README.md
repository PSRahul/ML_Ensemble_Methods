# ML_Ensemble_Methods
An investigation on ensemble machine learning methods for the MNIST dataset.

Trained an soft-voting classifier based on Random Forests and Support Vector Machine for the MNIST dataset. Achieved an test accuracy of 97.42%


A stacking classifier was also trained based on Random forests , extremely randomized Forests and Support Vector Machine for the MNIST dataset.Resulted in a test accuracy of 97.08%

Frameworks used - Scikit-Learn

Based on the exercise from “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly)
